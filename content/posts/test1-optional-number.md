title: Test 1 - Optional Number

a_number: 0

This is a test where the document was created outside of Forestry, committed to GIT and then imported
by Forestry.

The `a_number` front matter field was set to 0.

The Forestry Front Matter was also set to use the optionalNumberDefaultZero Template for this test.

Spot the difference?

Add the zero value back via Forestry...

Now, make a simple change outside of forestry and re-import. Number still set to zero?
