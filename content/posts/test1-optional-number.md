title: Test 1 - Optional Number

a_number: 0

This is a test where the document was created outside of Forestry, committed to GIT and then imported
by Forestry.

The `a_number` front matter field was set to 0.

The Forestry Front Matter was also set to use the optionalNumberDefaultZero Template for this test.

Spot the difference?

Add the zero value back via Forestry...

Now, make a simple change outside of forestry and re-import. Number still set to zero?

Forestry.io say they got this right this time. So repair the page in Forestry and then re-import from GitHub to see what happens this time?

So done the re-import and it still fails to read the zero back in. All I am doing here is changing the body text leaving the number metadata field alone. I'll save it and then see what I can see in GitHub.
