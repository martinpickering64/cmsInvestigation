This is a test where the document was created outside of Forestry, committed to GIT and then imported
by Forestry.

The `a_number` front matter field was set to 0.

The Forestry Front Matter was also set to use the mandatoryNumberDefaultZero Template for this test.

Forestry.io say they got this right this time. So repair the page in Forestry and then re-import from GitHub to see what happens this time?
